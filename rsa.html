<title>RSA Algorithm</title>
<h1>RSA Algorithm</h1>
<hr class="noshow">

<!-- Body Text begins -->
<p>
The RSA algorithm is named after Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman, who invented it in 1977

The basic technique was first discovered in 1973 by 
Clifford Cocks 
of CESG (part of the British GCHQ) but this was a secret until 1997.
The patent taken out by RSA Labs has expired.
</p>
    
    
<p>
The RSA cryptosystem is the most widely-used public key cryptography algorithm in the world.
It can be used to encrypt a message without the need to exchange a secret key separately.
</p>

<p>
The RSA algorithm can be used for both public key encryption and digital signatures. 
Its security is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers. 
</p>

<p>
Party A can send an encrypted message to party B without any prior exchange of secret keys.
A just uses B's public key to encrypt the message and B decrypts it using the private key, which only he knows.
RSA can also be used to sign a message, 
so A can sign a message using their private key and B can verify it using A's public key. 
</p>

    
    

<h2><a id="keygen"></a>Key Generation Algorithm</h2>
<p>This is the original algorithm.</p>
<ol class="vss">
<li>Generate two large random primes, $p$ and $q$, of approximately equal size such that
their product $n = pq$ is of the required bit length, e.g. 1024 bits. 

</li>
<li>Compute $n = pq$ and  $\phi = (p-1)(q-1)$.
</li>
	
<li>Choose an integer $e$, 
$1 &lt; e &lt; \phi$, such that $\gcd(e, \phi) = 1$. 
</li>

<li>Compute the secret exponent $d$, $1 &lt; d &lt; \phi$, such that
$ed \equiv 1 \bmod \phi$. </li>

<li>The public key is $(n, e)$ and the private key $(d, p, q)$. Keep all the values d, p, q and $\phi$ secret.
[Sometimes the private key is written as $(n, d)$ because you need the value of n when using d.
Other times we might write the key pair as $((N, e), d)$.]
</li>

<li>n is known as the <dfn>modulus</dfn>.</li>
<li>e is known as the <dfn>public exponent</dfn> or <dfn>encryption exponent</dfn> or just the <dfn>exponent</dfn>.</li>

<h2><a id="practicalkeygen"></a>A practical key generation algorithm</h2>
<p>
Incorporating the advice given in the <a href="#notespractical">notes below</a>, 
a practical algorithm to generate an RSA key pair is given below.
Typical bit lengths are $k = 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096,...$, with increasing computational expense for larger values.
You will not go far wrong if you choose $e$ as 65537 (=0x10001) in step (1).
</p>

<b>Algorithm:</b> Generate an RSA key pair.
<hr>
INPUT: Required modulus bit length, $k$. 
<br>
OUTPUT: An RSA key pair $((N,e), d)$ where N is the modulus, the product of two primes ($N=pq$) not exceeding $k$ bits in length; 
$e$ is the public exponent, a number less than and coprime to $(p-1)(q-1)$; 
and $d$ is the private exponent such that $ed \equiv 1 \bmod {(p-1)(q-1)}$.
<br>
<ol>
<li>Select a value of $e$ from ${3, 5, 17, 257, 65537}$</li>
<li><b>repeat</b></li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p &larr; genprime(k/2)</li>
<li><b>until</b> $(p \bmod e) \ne 1$
<li><b>repeat</b></li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q &larr; genprime(k - k/2)</li>
<li><b>until</b> $(q \bmod e) \ne 1$
<li>N &larr; pq</li>
<li>L &larr; (p-1)(q-1)</li>
<li>d &larr; modinv(e, L)</li>
<li><b>return</b> $(N, e, d)$</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>
The function <code>genprime(b)</code> returns a prime of exactly $b$ bits, with the $b$th bit set to 1.
Note that the operation $k/2$ is <em>integer</em> division giving the integer quotient with no fraction.
</p>
<p>
If you've chosen $e = 65537$ then the chances are that the first prime returned in steps (3) and (6) will pass the tests in steps (4) and (7), 
so each repeat-until loop will most likely just take one iteration. 
The final value of $N$ may have a bit length slightly short of the target $k$. 
This actually does not matter too much (providing the message m is always &lt; N), 
but some schemes require a modulus of exact length.
If this is the case, then just repeat the entire algorithm until you get one.
It should not take too many goes.

<h2><a id="encryption"></a>Encryption</h2>

Sender A does the following:-
</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtains the recipient B's public key $(n, e)$.</li>
<li>Represents the plaintext message as a positive integer $m$ with $1 &lt; m &lt; n$ 
	. </li>
<li>Computes the ciphertext $c = m^e \bmod n$.</li>
<li>Sends the ciphertext $c$ to B.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="decryption"></a>Decryption</h2>
<p>
Recipient B does the following:-
</p>
<ol>
<li>Uses his private key $(n, d)$ to compute $m = c^{d} \bmod n$.</li>
<li>Extracts the plaintext from the message representative $m$.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="signing"></a>Digital signing</h2>

<li>Represents this digest as an integer $m$ between 1 and $n-1$ \.</li>
<li>Uses her <em>private</em> key $(n, d)$ to compute the signature $s = m^{d} \bmod n$.</li>
<li>Sends this signature $s$ to the recipient, B.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="verification"></a>Signature verification</h2>

Recipient B does the following (<i>older method</i>):-

<ol>
<li>Uses sender A's public key $(n, e)$ to compute integer $v = s^{e} \bmod n$.</li>
<li>Extracts the message digest $H$ from this integer.</li>
<li>Independently computes the message digest $H'$ of the information that has been signed.</li>
<li>If both message digests are identical, i.e. $H=H'$, the signature is valid.</li>
</ol>
